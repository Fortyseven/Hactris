Hactris
=======

Ancient, fragile, unfinished C++ Tetris clone from 2009 using Allegro and IrrKlang

This is really old.  There are probably bugs, stupid mistakes, and much better ways to do what I did here.  But I wrote it at a time when I was forcing myself to speed through and just get a game up and running.

Just for fun, I may go back and play with this and clean it up.  It was already a wreck before I uploaded it, but it's a bit LESS of a mess after I did some tinkering just now, but it's STILL a mess.  Don't judge on this! :U

Requires Allegro 4.x. IrrKlang is optional.
